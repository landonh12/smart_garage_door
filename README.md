# Smart Garage Door Controller

This is a PCB made to house a NodeMCU-ESP32S to control my Genie Garage Door. It replaces the wall controller that was installed when we purchased the home.

The original circuit was simple - short RED and WHITE wires to open and close the door, and divide the voltage between RED and WHITE to toggle the garage light.

I used FETs for this - RFP30N06LEs to be exact. The board also supports STD26P3LLH6 FETs.
